# ByteView
ByteView - Another class and Java Archive viewer using VineFlower (currently only supported decompiler).

## Java Requirements
To build and run ByteView using an IDE, JDK 22 is required.

## Idea Behind ByteView
I have been wanting to try my hand at creating a modern Bytecode GUI that offers the user an experience like they would get in an actual IDE. This project (as it stands today; 6/10/2024) does not have all of the features that I have envisioned, however it does have the basic viewing features, so keep a watch for any updates.

### Current Features
  - Ability to look up the current class field, method, method parameter, and local variable usages (does not search through all classes)
  - Ability to go to the selected field, method, method parameter and local variables declaration

## Issues/Feedback
Do not hesitate to open an issue to bring up any bugs/errors and if you have any, ideas for future features.

## Contribute
Please contribute to any features that will enhance the user experience.
